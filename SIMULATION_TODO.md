### 2. Match Integration with Old Server âœ…
**Status:** Complete and working!
**Files modified:**
- `server/simulation/MatchAdapter.js` (NEW - 269 lines)
- `server/game/game.js` (added feature flag `useNewSimulation = true`)

**What Was Built:**
- âœ… MatchAdapter wraps MatchSimulator with old Match API

- Structure destruction working (Spires â†’ Gateways â†’ Core)
- CS, items, objectives all broadcasting correctly
- Winner determination working
- ~91 waves to completion (~12 minutes per match)

---

### 3. Admin Panel Demo Enhancement âœ…
**Status:** Complete
**Files modified:**
- `server.js:286-376` (enhanced `/api/admin/simulation/demo` endpoint)

**What Was Built:**
- âœ… Structure stats showing alive/destroyed counts for both teams
- âœ… Event summary with breakdown by type (562+ events tracked)
- âœ… Notable events list (objectives, structures, teamfights with wave numbers)
- âœ… Duration calculations (waves â†’ real-time minutes/seconds)
- âœ… Detailed champion stats (KDA, CS, gold, items, tilt)
- âœ… Increased maxWaves to 150 for natural match completion

**Test Results:**
- Demo completes in ~92 waves (~12 minutes)
- Winner determination working (team2 via core destruction)
- All enhanced stats displaying correctly
- Admin panel can now show rich simulation insights

---

### 4. UI Updates for New Terminology âœ…
**Status:** Complete
**Files modified:**
- `public/app.js` - Updated ticker messages with new terminology

**What Was Done:**
- âœ… MatchAdapter already outputs correct terminology (Spires, Gateway, Monolith, Prisms)
- âœ… Added new ticker messages: "SPIRES FALL. CORES CRUMBLE", "THE MONOLITH HUNGERS", etc.
- âœ… Event commentary uses surreal terminology from simulation
- âœ… Item purchases, tilt, structure destruction all displaying with new terms
- âœ… UI displays all event types from new simulation correctly

**Note:** The backend (MatchAdapter) was already using correct terminology! Only needed to update UI flavor text.

## ðŸŸ¡ Important But Not Critical

### 4. Chaos Event Integration
**Status:** System exists but not integrated
**File:** `server/game/chaosEvents.js` (346 lines)

**What's Needed:**
- Migrate ChaosEvents to new ChaosSystem
- Integrate with event log
- Apply chaos effects via Component system
- Weather system integration

**Current State:**
- Old chaos system fully functional
- New system skeleton exists but unused

---

### 5. Draft System Migration
**Status:** Old system works, new system partial
**Files:**
- `server/game/draft.js` (401 lines - old)
- `server/simulation/systems/DraftSystem.js` (doesn't exist yet)

**What's Needed:**
- Create DraftSystem.js
- Migrate snake draft logic
- Integrate with MatchSimulator
- Rarity-weighted champion selection
- Ban phase mechanics

**Current State:**
- Champions assigned to roles in MatchSimulator
- No actual draft simulation in new engine

---

### 6. Balance Tuning
**Status:** Not started

**Areas Needing Tuning:**
- Teamfight damage values
- Item costs and stat values
- Lane pressure thresholds
- Objective contest power calculations
- Tilt accumulation rates
- CS difficulty thresholds
- Gank success rates
- Steal chances

**Method:**
- Run 1000+ matches with different configs
- Analyze win rate distributions
- Adjust coefficients in system config objects
- Create balance patch notes

---

### 7. Performance Optimization
**Status:** Unknown (not tested at scale)

**Target:** 500+ matches/hour/core

**Potential Issues:**
- Event log memory growth
- Component query performance
- RNG overhead
- State serialization cost

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Event log pruning
- Component indexing improvements
- Lazy stat calculations
- Snapshot compression

   - Update WebSocket broadcasts
   - Test with existing UI
   - Verify matches complete properly

3. **UI Terminology Update** (2-3 hours)
   - Update all UI text
   - Add new event displays
   - Test visual presentation

4. **Chaos Integration** (2-3 hours)
   - Migrate chaos events
   - Test chaos effects
   - Verify absurdist moments

5. **Balance Pass** (ongoing)

   - Collect metrics
   - Adjust coefficients
   - Iterate

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

A match is "production ready" when:
- âœ… Matches complete with a winner (tower destruction)
- âœ… All events broadcast correctly via WebSocket
- âœ… UI displays match progression understandably
- âœ… Deterministic replays work
- âœ… Performance target met (500+ matches/hour)
- âœ… Chaos events feel appropriately absurd
- âœ… Win rates are balanced (no team dominates >60%)

---

## ðŸ“Š Current Stats

**Lines of Code:**
- Core: 695 lines (RNG, ECS, EventLog, Engine)
- Systems: 1,696 lines (6 systems)
- Data: 465 lines (items, terminology)
- Tests: 572 lines
- **Total: 3,428 lines**

**Event Types:** 30+
**Systems:** 6 (Items, Lane, Jungle, Teamfight, Tilt, Objective)
**Items:** 20
**Objectives:** 6 (5 Prisms + Monolith)
**Test Coverage:** Basic determinism verified

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- The old Match system is still fully functional - no rush to migrate
- New system can run in parallel for testing
- Admin panel demo proves all systems work
- Biggest risk: UI/UX changes from terminology shift
- Consider gradual rollout (new engine for some matches)

**Last Updated:** Sprint 3 Complete
**Next Milestone:** Win condition + basic integration
