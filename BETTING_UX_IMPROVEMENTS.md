# Betting UX Improvements

This document describes the improvements made to the betting system to make it fully functional.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. **Bet Payouts Not Working**
**Problem:** Users were placing bets but never receiving payouts when they won.

**Solution:**
- Modified `broadcastBetResults()` in `server/game/game.js` to actually pay out winners
- Winner balances are now updated in both WebSocket connection and database
- Losing bets are also recorded in the database for bet history tracking

**Files Changed:**
- `server/game/game.js:551-630` - Added payout logic to `broadcastBetResults()`
- `server/game/game.js:320` - Made function call await the async payout process

### 2. **Balance Not Persisting**
**Problem:** User balances were stored in memory but not synchronized with the database.

**Solution:**
- When users win bets, their balance is immediately updated in the database via `database.updateUserBalance()`
- When users authenticate via WebSocket, their balance is loaded from the database
- Bet results (win/loss) are recorded in the `betting_history` table with `database.resolveBet()`

**Files Changed:**
- `server/game/game.js:566` - Update user balance in database after payout
- `server/game/game.js:569-575` - Record winning bets in database
- `server/game/game.js:598-605` - Record losing bets in database

### 3. **Client Not Showing Balance Updates**
**Problem:** When users won bets, their balance display didn't update.

**Solution:**
- Server now sends `newBalance` field in `bet_results` message
- Client listens for this field and updates the balance display immediately

**Files Changed:**
- `public/app.js:192-196` - Update balance display when bet results received
- `public/app.js:684-700` - Enhanced `showBetResults()` with better notifications

### 4. **Database User Management Issues**
**Problem:** Database came pre-populated with test users, preventing new registrations.

**Solution:**
- Created `scripts/reset-users.js` utility to manage database users
- Can list users, delete specific users, reset balances, or clear all users
- Added documentation in `scripts/README.md`

**Files Changed:**
- `scripts/reset-users.js` (NEW) - Database user management utility
- `scripts/README.md` (NEW) - Documentation for utility scripts

### 5. **Poor Bet Result Notifications**
**Problem:** Users didn't get clear feedback when they won or lost bets.

**Solution:**
- Added celebratory notification with emoji when winning
- Shows profit amount clearly
- Adds celebratory message to match feed
- Different messages for users who bet vs. spectators

**Files Changed:**
- `public/app.js:684-700` - Enhanced notification messages

## How the Betting System Works Now

### Full Betting Flow

1. **Match Starts:**
   - `game.runMatchWithBetting()` is called
   - Betting pool is created via `bettingSystem.createMatchBetting()`
   - Odds are calculated and broadcast to all clients
   - Clients see betting odds in the UI

2. **Users Place Bets:**
   - User enters amount and selects team in UI
   - Client sends `{type: 'bet', team, amount, matchId}` to server
   - Server validates bet and deducts balance from WebSocket connection
   - Bet is recorded in database via `persistenceManager.recordUserBet()`
   - Server stores `betId` in `ws._activeBets[matchId]`
   - Updated odds are broadcast to all clients

3. **Match Ends:**
   - Betting is locked via `bettingSystem.lockBetting()`
   - Winner is determined by match simulation
   - `bettingSystem.resolveBets()` calculates payouts based on odds
   - `game.broadcastBetResults()` processes payouts:
     - Winner balances updated in memory and database
     - Bet records updated in database with result
     - All clients notified of match winner
     - Winners get special notification with payout details

4. **Balance Updates:**
   - Winners: Balance increased by payout amount
   - Losers: Balance already deducted when bet was placed
   - All changes persisted to database
   - Client UI updates to show new balance

## Database Schema Used

```sql
-- User accounts with balances
users (
  id, username, password_hash, display_name,
  balance, corruption_level, is_admin, created_at
)

-- Bet history for analytics
betting_history (
  id, user_id, season_number, match_id, team_bet,
  amount, odds, result, payout, profit, timestamp
)
```

## Testing the System

### Reset Database for Testing

```bash
# List all users
node scripts/reset-users.js --list

# Reset all balances to 1000
node scripts/reset-users.js --reset-balances

# Delete a test user
node scripts/reset-users.js --username testuser

# Delete all users (requires --confirm)
node scripts/reset-users.js --all --confirm
```

### Test Betting Flow

1. Start the server: `node server.js`
2. Register a new account (first user becomes admin)
3. Wait for a match to start
4. Place a bet on one of the teams
5. Watch the match
6. When match ends, check if you won
7. Verify balance updated correctly

### Verify Database Persistence

1. Place a bet and win
2. Note your new balance
3. Refresh the browser
4. Log back in
5. Verify balance matches what you had before

## Key Files Modified

- `server/game/game.js` - Added payout logic and database persistence
- `public/app.js` - Added balance update handling and better notifications
- `scripts/reset-users.js` (NEW) - User management utility
- `scripts/README.md` (NEW) - Documentation

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Bet history page showing past bets
- Live betting statistics (win rate, profit/loss over time)
- Betting achievements (10 wins in a row, etc.)
- Bet limits to prevent bankrupting users
- Daily balance reset or void tax system
- Multi-bet parlays (bet on multiple matches)
