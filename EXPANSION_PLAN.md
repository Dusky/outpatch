## PHASE 1: Foundation - ECS Migration & Core Systems
**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Priority:** CRITICAL (blocks all other features)

### 1.1 Complete ECS Engine Migration
**Goal:** Fully migrate from legacy Match.js to the new ECS-based simulation engine

#### Tasks:
- [ ] **Finish ItemSystem integration**
  - Current state: Basic system exists, needs passives/active items
  - Add: Item passive effects (Thornmail reflect, BotRK % health damage)
  - Add: Active items (if desired)
  - Add: Item randomness (champions deviate from build paths)

- [ ] **Implement Ability System (NEW)**
  - Create `AbilitySystem.js` in `/server/simulation/systems/`
  - Each champion gets 4 abilities (Q, W, E, R/Ultimate)
  - Abilities have: cooldowns, mana costs, damage types, effects
  - Store champion ability data in `/server/simulation/data/abilities.json`
  - Abilities scale with stats (AD, AP, level)

- [ ] **Migrate Chaos Events to ECS**
  - Port ChaosManager to work with World entities
  - Chaos events now modify Entity components instead of raw objects
  - Add chaos event tracking to EventLog

- [ ] **Integrate Weather System into ECS**
  - Port WeatherSystem to work with World
  - Weather affects chaos chance, item gold costs, ability damage

- [ ] **Update Match Simulation to Use ECS**
  - Modify `server/game/game.js` to use MatchSimulator instead of legacy Match
  - Ensure WebSocket broadcasts still work
  - Test concurrent matches with ECS engine

- [ ] **Add Replay System**
  - Store match snapshots every 10 waves
  - Save full event log to database
  - Create API endpoints: `/api/matches/:id/replay`
  - Add replay seed storage for deterministic re-simulation

#### Deliverables:
- âœ… ECS engine is default simulation method
- âœ… All chaos events work in ECS
- âœ… Deterministic replays functional
- âœ… Item system complete with passives
- âœ… Ability system foundation ready

#### Testing:
- Run 100 matches with same seed â†’ verify identical outcomes
- Compare ECS vs Legacy match quality
- Verify no memory leaks with concurrent matches

---

## PHASE 2: Abilities & Combat Depth
**Duration:** 1.5 weeks

### 2.1 Champion Ability Design
**Goal:** Each champion has unique abilities that affect match outcomes

#### Ability Categories:
1. **Damage Abilities** (Q/W/E)
   - Single target damage
   - AOE damage
   - Skill shots (miss chance based on mechanical_skill)

2. **Utility Abilities**
   - Crowd Control (stuns, slows, roots)
   - Shields and healing

    - Top: Tankier abilities, CC
    - Jungle: Mobility, damage
    - Mid: Burst damage, skill shots
    - ADC: Sustained damage, positioning
    - Support: Heals, shields, CC

- [ ] **Ability Data Structure**
```json
{
  "id": "fireball",
  "name": "Void Fireball",
  "type": "damage",
  "cooldown": 8,
  "manaCost": 60,
  "damage": { "base": 80, "scaling": { "ap": 0.6 } },
  "effects": ["magic_damage", "aoe"],
  "flavor": "Hurls corrupted fire from beyond reality"
}
```

- [ ] **Ability Usage in Simulation**
  - During laning: Use Q/W/E for trades
  - During teamfights: Use all abilities + ultimate
  - Cooldown tracking per champion
  - Mana resource management
  - Ability hit/miss based on mechanical_skill vs game_sense

- [ ] **Ability Commentary**
  - Log ability usage: "{Champion} casts {Ability}!"
  - Critical hits: "{Champion}'s {Ability} OBLITERATES {Target}!"
  - Ult usage: "ðŸ”¥ {Champion} activates {ULTIMATE}!"

#### Deliverables:
- âœ… 20-30 unique abilities defined

  - Chain CC (stun â†’ root â†’ slow)
  - Shield/heal timing based on ally HP

- [ ] **Teamfight Phases**
  - Engage phase (initiation)
  - Burst phase (abilities fired)
  - Cleanup phase (low HP targets eliminated)

- [ ] **Comeback Mechanics**
  - Losing team gets desperation bonus (clutch_factor)
  - Ace gold (killing entire team) grants massive gold
  - Shutdown gold (killing fed enemy) gives bonus gold

#### Implementation in TeamfightSystem.js:
```javascript
// Phase-based team fighting
1. Determine engagement (who initiates based on comp)
2. Fire abilities in priority order (CC â†’ Damage â†’ Ults)
3. Calculate damage with positioning modifiers
4. Apply deaths and distribute gold/XP
5. Log detailed play-by-play
```

#### Deliverables:
- âœ… Teamfights have positioning mechanics

**2. Chaos Escalation**
- [ ] Chaos level increases faster in close matches
- [ ] More chaos = more unpredictability

**3. Tilt Impact**
- [ ] High tilt can cause throw moments
- [ ] "Mental boom" events where champion plays terribly
- [ ] Random tilt spikes from deaths/losses

**4. Hidden Stat Impact**
- [ ] Clutch factor matters more in close fights
- [ ] Game sense helps predict/dodge abilities
- [ ] Tilt resistance prevents mental boom

#### Implementation:
- [ ] Add variance to ability damage (Â±15%)
- [ ] Increase chaos event frequency in close games
- [ ] Add tilt spikes on death/loss streaks
- [ ] Weight hidden stats more heavily in outcomes

#### Deliverables:
- âœ… Match outcomes less predictable
- âœ… Upsets happen regularly
- âœ… Hidden stats matter

## PHASE 9: Polish & Testing
**Duration:** 1 week
**Priority:** CRITICAL (before launch)

### 9.1 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile match simulation (ensure <100ms per wave)
- [ ] Optimize database queries (add indexes)
- [ ] Minimize WebSocket message size
- [ ] Add client-side caching
- [ ] Lazy load match history/replays

### 9.2 Bug Fixes
- [ ] Test all chaos events for edge cases
- [ ] Verify ECS engine has no memory leaks
- [ ] Ensure replays are deterministic (100 test runs)
- [ ] Fix any UI rendering issues
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness (if desired)

### 9.3 Balance Tuning
- [ ] Adjust item costs for balance
- [ ] Tune ability damage/cooldowns
- [ ] Adjust chaos event frequencies
- [ ] Balance comeback mechanics (not too strong)
- [ ] Tune hidden stat weights

### 9.4 Documentation
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new architecture
- [ ] Document ability system
- [ ] Document chaos events
- [ ] API documentation for new endpoints
- [ ] User guide for new UI features

## PHASE 10: Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
**Duration:** Ongoing
**Priority:** LOW (nice-to-have)

### Ideas for Later:
- [ ] Banning phase before matches
- [ ] Draft system (teams pick champions from pool)
- [ ] Coaching system (AI coach gives advice)
- [ ] Tournament mode (brackets, playoffs)
- [ ] Custom game mode (user-created rulesets)
- [ ] Mobile app
- [ ] Twitch integration (stream matches)
- [ ] Betting leagues and competitions
- [ ] Social features (friend lists, chat)
- [ ] Champion skins/cosmetics
- [ ] Voice lines for champions
- [ ] Sound effects and music

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk:
- **ECS Migration Complexity** - May introduce bugs. *Mitigation: Extensive testing, parallel run with legacy*
- **Performance Degradation** - More systems = slower. *Mitigation: Profiling, optimization*
- **Scope Creep** - Features expand indefinitely. *Mitigation: Stick to plan, defer nice-to-haves*

### Medium Risk:
- **Replay Determinism** - Hard to guarantee. *Mitigation: Seeded RNG, extensive testing*
- **UI Complexity** - Canvas rendering can be tricky. *Mitigation: Use libraries, incremental development*
- **Balance Issues** - New systems may be broken. *Mitigation: Tuning phase, player feedback*

### Low Risk:
- **Database Schema Changes** - Well-understood. *Mitigation: Migrations, backups*
- **Chaos Event Bugs** - Easy to isolate. *Mitigation: Unit tests per event*

## Conclusion

This plan transforms the MOBA Blaseball simulator from a functional prototype into a feature-rich, engaging simulation with deep systems, compelling UI, and emergent storytelling. The phased approach allows for incremental progress while maintaining a working product at each stage.

**Estimated Total Effort:** 6-8 weeks (1 developer, full-time)
**Key Dependencies:** Phase 1 must complete before others begin
**Recommended Approach:** Execute phases sequentially, with daily testing and iteration

Let's build something amazing. The void awaits.
